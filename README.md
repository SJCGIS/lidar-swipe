# LiDAR Swipe

LiDAR is an imagery method to create representations of Earth's surface. The LiDAR Swipe map is designed for users to view a bare earth hillshade image created from LiDAR data in San Juan County, WA. In this case, you can drag the swipe bar across the map to compare the 2013 aerial photos with the 2013 LiDAR hillshade.
